     *                            If true, perform them as implemented in TorchANI (https://github.com/aiqm/torchani).  They differ in two ways.
     *                            First, TorchANI divides the radial symmetry functions by 4.  Second, when computing angles it multiplies the
     *                            dot product by 0.95.  This leads to large errors in angles, especially ones that are close to 0 or pi.
