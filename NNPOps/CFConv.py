    Optimized continious-filter convolution layer (CFConv)

    CFConv is used in SchNet (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08566).

    Example::

        from NNPOps.CFConv import CFConv

        # Set parameters

        numGaussians = 3
        cutoff = 5.0
        gaussianWidth = 1.0
        activation = 'ssp'
        weights1 = torch.rand(numGaussians, numFilters)
        biases1 = torch.rand(numFilters)
        weights2 = torch.rand(numFilters, numFilters)
        biases2 = torch.rand(numFilters)

        # Generate random input
        positions = (10*torch.rand(numAtoms, 3) - 5).detach()
        positions.requires_grad = True
        input = torch.rand(numAtoms, numFilters)

        # Create objects
        neighbors = CFConvNeighbors(cutoff)
        conv = CFConv(gaussianWidth, activation, weights1, biases1, weights2, biases2)

        # Run forward and backward passes
        neighbors.build(positions)
        output = conv(neighbors, positions, input)
        total = torch.sum(output)
        total.backward()
        grad = positions.grad
