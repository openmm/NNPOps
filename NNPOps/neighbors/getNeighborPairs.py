def getNeighborPairs(

    """Returns indices and distances of atom pairs within a given cutoff distance.

    If `max_num_pairs == -1` (default), all the atom pairs are returned,
    i.e. `num_pairs = num_atoms * (num_atoms + 1) / 2`. This is intended for
    the small molecules, where almost all the atoms are within the cutoff
    distance of each other.

    If  `max_num_pairs >  0`, a  fixed number  of the  atom pairs  are
    returned.  This is  intended for large molecule, where  most of the
    atoms are beyond the cutoff distance of each other.

    This function optionally supports periodic boundary conditions with
    arbitrary triclinic boxes.  The box vectors `a`, `b`, and `c` must satisfy
    certain requirements:

    `a[1] = a[2] = b[2] = 0`
    `a[0] >= 2*cutoff, b[1] >= 2*cutoff, c[2] >= 2*cutoff`
    `a[0] >= 2*b[0]`
    `a[0] >= 2*c[0]`
    `b[1] >= 2*c[1]`

    These requirements correspond to a particular rotation of the system and
    reduced form of the vectors, as well as the requirement that the cutoff be
    no larger than half the box width.

    Parameters
    ----------
    positions: `torch.Tensor`
        Atomic positions. The tensor shape has to be `(num_atoms, 3)` and
        data type has to be`torch.float32` or `torch.float64`.
    cutoff: float
        Maximum distance between atom pairs.
    max_num_pairs: int, optional
        Maximum number of pairs (total number of neighbors). If set to `-1` (default),
        all possible combinations of atom pairs are included.
    box_vectors: `torch.Tensor`, optional
        The vectors defining the periodic box.  This must have shape `(3, 3)`,
        where `box_vectors[0] = a`, `box_vectors[1] = b`, and `box_vectors[2] = c`.
        If this is omitted, periodic boundary conditions are not applied.
    check_errors: bool, optional
        If True, a RuntimeError is raised if more than max_num_pairs pairs are found.
        The error checking requires synchronization, which adds cost and makes this function
        incompatible with CUDA graphs. If this argument is False, no error checking is performed.
        This makes it faster and compatible with CUDA graphs, but it is your responsibility
        to check the return value for number_found_pairs to make sure that no neighbors were missed.
        Default: False

    Returns
    -------
    neighbors: `torch.Tensor`
        Atom pair indices. The shape of the tensor is `(2, num_pairs)`.
        If an atom pair is separated by a larger distance than the cutoff,
        the indices are set to `-1`.

    deltas: `torch.Tensor`
        Atom pair displacement vectors. The shape of the tensor is `(num_pairs, 3)`.
        The direction of the vectors are from `neighbors[1]` to `neighbors[0]`.
        If an atom pair is separated by a larger distance than the cutoff,
        the displacement vector is set to `[NaN, NaN, NaN]`.

    distances: `torch.Tensor`
        Atom pair distances. The shape of the tensor is `(num_pairs)`.
        If an atom pair is separated by a larger distance than the cutoff,
        the distance is set to `NaN`.

    number_found_pairs: `torch.Tensor`
        Contains the  total number  of pairs found.  Be aware  that if
        check_errors   is   False,   this   might   be   larger   than
        max_num_pairs. In  that case,  the output  tensors contain
        only a subset of the pairs that were found, and the others are
        omitted. Which pairs get omitted may vary between invocations.

    Exceptions
    ----------
    If `max_num_pairs > 0` and too small, `RuntimeError` is raised if check_errors=True.

    Note
    ----
    The operation  can be compatible  with CUDA Graphs: the  shapes of
    the output tensors are independent of the values of input tensors,
    and  no  synchronization  is  performed.
    For  this  to  be  true, check_errors must be False.

    The CUDA implementation returns the atom pairs in non-determinist order,
    if `max_num_pairs > 0`.
